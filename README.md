### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AayushKumar880/Im-Beside-You
    cd Im-Beside-You
    ```

    Alternatively, open **Android Studio**, go to `File -> New -> Project from Version Control`, and paste the repository link: [I'm Beside You Prototype GitHub](https://github.com/AayushKumar880/Chat-Room-App.git).

2. **Set Up Firebase**:
    - Navigate to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project (or use an existing one).
    - Add an Android app to your Firebase project with your app‚Äôs package name.
    - Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in the `app` directory.
    - Follow the [Firebase setup instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) to add Firebase SDKs.
  
    NOTE: You can skip this step as for testing the app, my Firebase account already added to it.

3. **Set Up Google Gemini API**:
    - Get your API key from [Google Gemini API](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and add it to your project‚Äôs `local.properties` and ensure to declare it as `API_KEY`.
    - Example: API_KEY = XYZ123

4. **Set Up Agora.io API**:
    - Obtain your API key from [Agora.io API](https://www.agora.io/en/) and include it in the project‚Äôs `local.properties` for enabling video calls and ensure to declare it as `apiId`.
    - Example: apikey = XYZ123

5. **Sync Gradle Files**:
    - Ensure that all Gradle dependencies are resolved. Go to `File -> Sync Project with Gradle Files` to ensure all libraries are installed.

6. **Run the App**:
    - Select a device or emulator and click on the "Run" button to install and run the app.

## üß© Architecture Overview

The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability.

1. **Model**:
   - Handles all data operations. Firebase Firestore is used for real-time data management and storage.
  
2. **View**:
   - Jetpack Compose is used for building the app's UI, displaying data, and handling user interactions. Compose allows building reactive UI with less boilerplate code.
  
3. **ViewModel**:
   - The ViewModel manages the UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way. It acts as a bridge between the Model and the View, ensuring the UI is updated when the data changes without affecting the lifecycle.
