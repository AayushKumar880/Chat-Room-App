## üß© Architecture Overview

The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability.

1. **Model**:
   - Handles all data operations. Firebase Firestore is used for real-time data management and storage.
  
2. **View**:
   - Jetpack Compose is used for building the app's UI, displaying data, and handling user interactions. Compose allows building reactive UI with less boilerplate code.
  
3. **ViewModel**:
   - The ViewModel manages the UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way. It acts as a bridge between the Model and the View, ensuring the UI is updated when the data changes without affecting the lifecycle.
